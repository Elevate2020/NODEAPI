Make sure Node.js is installed in your system by running the below command in Terminal/CMD
  
####  node --version

If not installed, please install it by downloading the latest stable Node version from 'https://nodejs.org/en/download/'


Use any IDE/Text editor for project coding (such as Visual Studio code / Atom)


Setup your initial project structure by running below command - 

####    npm init

This will ask you few question, answer the same or just hit 'Enter' to use the default values. This will create a bare project skeleton with package.json file.


Either you can add dependency in the file itself or install dependency in your terminal and node will update the package.json accordingly.

 e.g - lets try adding express package to our project.

#### npm install express or npm install express@specific_version

#### ^ = it will download the latest version automaticlly.
